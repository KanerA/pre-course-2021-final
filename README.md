# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Pre Course Project - Todo List üìã

Hi, this is my README file for the To-Do list project!

On this page you will see the features I added to the app, and what they do.

Hope you enjoy the use and features.

# My To-DO List's Features:

## Dark Mode:

On the top right corner there's a button you can use to toggle between Light mode and Dark mode.

The button states the current mode.

Dark mode preference is saved in your browser's local storage,

giving you the choice to customize the default mode on each of your devices,

just click the mode button and it will stay the same every time you enter the app.

## JSON Bin:

The changes you make on the list are stored in the JSON Bin,

waiting for you to come back and add some more to-do's.

## Mark / UnMark as Completed:

Each of the to-do tasks has a check button which marks or unmarks the task as done.

When marked as done, the task will go to the bottom of the list.

## Delete Task:

Each of the the to-do tasks has a delete button, that deletes the wanted to-do from the screen & the JSONBin back-up,
making it persistent.

## Edit Task:

In order to edit a task you need to press the edit button on the left side of the task.

An input window will open up where you will write the text you actually want in the to-do.

When ready to make the changes permanent, press the EDIT button, right next to the input area.

- If no input is given, an alert will show.

## Priority Animation:

Any to-do labeled with a priority of 5, will blink red to remind you it's importance.

## Search Bar:

On the top right corner of your screen, you'll find a search bar.

In this bar you can search for tasks on the list, and the one you're looking for
will pop to the top of the list.

You can search with parts of the word / sentence you're looking for and a match can still be made.

If you click on the search button without entering any keywords, a custom alert will pop at the head of the page.

- If you have a couple of tasks that contains the word or the phrase you searched, the first one on the list
  will be chosen.
- The search IS case sensitive.

## Contact Links:

Up in the Top left corner, I included links to my social media.

## Network Loading Spinner:

While the page is waiting for API fetch requests, there will be a spinner in the middle of the screen.

## Sort Function:

By clicking on the Sort button, the list will be organized by each task priority, from 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest).

## Add To-Do alert:

If the to-do input element is empty when pressing the add button, an alert will be shown , asking to enter text.

## responsivness:

The app is responsive, making everything smaller on a less wide screen.
